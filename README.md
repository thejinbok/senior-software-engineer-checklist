# Senior Software Engineer Checklist
ðŸ“Œ A Senior Software Engineer's CheckList

## Story time
A few years ago I came across [this post by Little Blah](https://littleblah.com/post/2019-09-01-senior-engineer-checklist).
I thought: hmm, I liked it.
Once I consider myself senior, I'll use this checklist to guide what has been left for me to achieve in my career as a software engineer.
And here I am.

I could do this self-assessment any number of ways, but I decided to do it on GitHub for three main reasons:
1. I can use the repository as a resource to help people and companies that want to hire me get a better sense of who I am, what I've done and what I want to achieve.
2. I think maybe other people want to do the same, so they can just [fork the repository](https://github.com/thejinbok/senior-software-engineer-checklist/fork).
3. Because I wanted to.

So without further ado, here is the checklist.

## The Checklist
